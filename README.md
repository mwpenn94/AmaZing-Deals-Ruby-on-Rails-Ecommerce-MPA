# Ecommerce CMS Made in Rails (AmaZing Deals)

## Description

This is a Simple Ecommerce Application. Depending on their permissions, it allows users CRUD functionality across multiple objects involved in a large scale ecommerce marketplace applicaton -departments, categories, products, questions, answers, reviews, tags, carts, lineitems, orders, etc.

Similar to large scale counterparts, it is designed for straightforward use with minimal explanation required for the user.

Omniauth Github authentication has been included for ease of access. See spec.md in the roort directory for a list of additional features.
